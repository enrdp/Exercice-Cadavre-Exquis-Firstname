# History Of Nikola Tesla
Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree,
 gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at 
 Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. 
 In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. 


 He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices
